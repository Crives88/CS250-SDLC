This repo is for my portfolio creation assignment in my CS250 class

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is at the core of successful software development. To achieve this, creating "user stories" is a valuable technique. User stories are concise descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. They help bridge the gap between technical development and end-user requirements. By detailing the who, what, why, and acceptance criteria for a feature, they provide a clear roadmap for development teams. When developing programs, it's crucial to adopt an agile approach. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, promote iterative development, frequent user feedback, and adaptability. This allows you to incorporate changing user needs efficiently and ensures the end product aligns closely with what users truly require.

Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability. It's essential to actively engage with team members and stakeholders, seeking and providing feedback, and working together to solve problems. Embracing agile principles like transparency and self-organization can lead to better teamwork. Additionally, a good team member should be open to learning and continuous improvement, staying up-to-date with evolving technologies and best practices to deliver high-quality software that meets user needs effectively.
